# hello-world
This is the first try in github.

//2020/12/27  The procedure to update this repository

git clone [url] newfilename

change files

git add .

git commit -m [message]
or git commit then F2

This step commit files changed to local repository,so we still need to push them to the remote repository.

git push


// Then I add a new branch "testing"
The branch "testing" is a new branch in local repository.
So I should merge it to master branch and then push it to remote repository.

//git checkout testing or git branch -b testing to enter the testing branch

git merge testing

git push

// first change made in 2018.6.9 00:02:00
